# 📊 Student Grade Analyzer — Python List-Based Analysis

This project is a **Python console application** that analyzes student exam grades using **lists and loops**.  
The program collects grades from multiple students, stores them in a list, and generates a detailed statistical report.

It is designed to practice **list operations**, **iteration**, and **basic data analysis** in Python.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

- Practice working with lists in Python  
- Analyze numerical data stored in a list  
- Apply loops for aggregation and classification  
- Calculate statistical values such as average, minimum, and maximum  
- Build a clean, readable console-based analysis tool

## ⚙️ Program Features

- Takes the number of students as input  
- Collects exam grades dynamically  
- Stores all grades in a list  
- Calculates:
  - Average grade  
  - Highest grade  
  - Lowest grade  
  - Number of passing students  
  - Number of failing students  
- Prints all entered grades clearly  

Passing condition:
- Grade **≥ 50** → Pass  
- Grade **< 50** → Fail

- `for` loops  
- Conditional logic (`if–else`)  
- Accumulator variables  
- Basic statistical calculations  
- Console input/output
