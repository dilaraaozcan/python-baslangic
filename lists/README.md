# 📋 Lists — List-Based Applications & Data Analysis (Python)

This folder contains **Python console applications** developed to practice and reinforce the use of **lists**.  
Each project focuses on storing, processing, and analyzing collections of data using list structures combined with loops and conditional logic.

The examples are designed to help learners understand how lists are used in real-world data processing scenarios.
