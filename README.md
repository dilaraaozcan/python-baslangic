# 🐍 Python Learning Projects — Structured Practice Repository

This repository is a **personal learning workspace** that contains the Python fundamentals, exercises, and mini projects I have developed while learning Python.  
The projects are organized by topic to clearly document my progress, reinforce core concepts, and build a structured programming portfolio.

The focus of this repository is **hands-on practice**, clean logic, and gradual improvement through real examples.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Learn Python fundamentals step by step  
- Strengthen algorithmic and logical thinking  
- Practice control structures, data types, and functions  
- Build interactive console applications  
- Maintain a clean and organized learning archive on GitHub

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each folder focuses on a specific Python concept or programming pattern:

- **if-else/**  
  Conditional logic projects (BMI Calculator, decision-based programs)

- **loops/**  
  Loop-based algorithms (`for`, `while`), number analysis, repetition logic

- **match-case/**  
  Menu-driven systems using Python 3.10+ `match–case` syntax  
  (e.g. Student Course Management System)

- **functions/**  
  Function-oriented applications emphasizing modular design  
  (e.g. geometry_app with reusable calculation functions)

- **strings/**  
  String manipulation, character analysis, conversions, digit-based algorithms

- **arrays / lists-dicts/**  
  List and dictionary operations, data analysis, classification tasks

- **mini-projects/**  
  Small but complete console applications combining multiple concepts  
  (ATM system, games, calculators, smart assistants, etc.)

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Variables and data types  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`)  
- Lists, dictionaries, and basic data structures  
- String processing and character analysis  
- Functions and modular programming  
- Menu-based console applications  
- Input validation and error handling  
- Algorithmic problem solving

## ▶️ Running the Code

Each project is **self-contained**.

To run any project:
1. Navigate to the project folder  
2. Run the Python file:
   python main.py  
3. Follow the instructions shown in the console  

You can use **VS Code**, **PyCharm**, or any standard Python IDE.

## 🌱 Learning Progress

This repository is actively growing as I continue learning Python.  
New topics, improved solutions, and more advanced mini projects will be added over time.

The goal is not only to write code, but to **understand why it works**.
