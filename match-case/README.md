# 🔀 Match-Case — Menu & Decision Systems (Python)

This folder contains **Python console applications** developed to practice the `match–case` structure, introduced in **Python 3.10+**.  
The projects focus on menu-driven systems where user selections are handled in a clean, readable, and structured way.

Each example demonstrates how `match–case` can replace long `if–elif–else` chains for better clarity and maintainability.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Folder

- Learn and practice the `match–case` statement  
- Build menu-based console applications  
- Improve decision-making logic readability  
- Handle user input safely and clearly  
- Apply structured branching logic to real problems

## 📂 Included Projects

### ▶️ Student Course Management System
A menu-driven application that allows users to manage a list of courses interactively.

Features:
- Add new courses dynamically  
- Display all added courses  
- Remove selected courses  
- Input validation and safe exit handling  

`match–case` usage:
- Menu option handling  
- Clean separation of actions based on user choice

## 🧠 Python Concepts Practiced

- `match–case` control structure  
- Infinite loops (`while True`)  
- Input validation  
- List operations (`append`, `remove`)  
- String comparison  
- Menu-based program flow
