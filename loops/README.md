# 🔁 Loops — Iteration & Algorithm Practice (Python)

This folder contains **Python console applications** designed to practice and strengthen the use of **loops** (`for` and `while`).  
Each project focuses on repeating operations, algorithmic thinking, and processing numerical data through iteration.

The examples are beginner-friendly and demonstrate how loops are used to control program flow and solve mathematical problems.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Folder

- Understand how loops control repeated execution  
- Practice `for` and `while` loop structures  
- Combine loops with conditional logic  
- Implement basic mathematical algorithms  
- Improve problem-solving and algorithmic thinking

## 📂 Included Projects

### ▶️ Number Analysis Tool
A menu-driven application that performs multiple analyses on a given number using loops.

Features:
- Prime number checking  
- Factorial calculation  
- Armstrong number verification  
- Continuous execution until exit  

Loop usage:
- `for` loop for prime checking and factorial calculation  
- `while` loop for Armstrong number digit analysis  
- Infinite loop (`while True`) for menu control
