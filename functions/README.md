# 🧩 Functions — Function-Based Applications (Python)

This folder contains **Python console applications** developed to practice and reinforce the use of **functions**.  
Each project focuses on separating logic into reusable functions, improving code readability, modularity, and maintainability.

The examples demonstrate how functions can be used to organize complex logic into clean, manageable components.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Folder

- Understand how functions improve code structure  
- Practice defining and calling functions  
- Learn parameter passing and return values  
- Separate business logic from program flow  
- Build reusable and modular Python programs  

---

## 📂 Included Projects

### ▶️ Geometry App
A geometric area calculator that computes the surface areas of various shapes using **independent functions**.

Features:
- Circle area calculation  
- Square area calculation  
- Rectangle area calculation with validation  
- Triangle area calculation  
- Cylinder surface area calculation  

Key concepts:
- Function definitions with parameters  
- Returning numerical values  
- Use of the `math` module  
- Menu-driven program design  
- Error handling with `try–except`  

---

## 🧠 Python Concepts Practiced

- Function definition and invocation  
- Parameters and return values  
- Code reuse and modular design  
- Infinite loops (`while True`)  
- Input validation  
- Exception handling  
- Mathematical computations
