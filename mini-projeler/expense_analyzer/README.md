# 💰 Expense Analyzer — Category-Based Budget Analysis (Python)

This project is a **Python console application** that analyzes personal expenses across predefined categories and generates a structured weekly summary.

Users can enter daily spending amounts for selected categories, and the program calculates total expenses, percentage distribution, and identifies the highest spending category.

The application is designed as a mini project to practice **dictionaries, lists, loops, comprehensions, and data aggregation logic**.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

- Practice organizing data using dictionaries  
- Store multiple expense entries in lists  
- Perform category-level aggregation  
- Calculate total and percentage distributions  
- Identify the maximum spending category  
- Build a structured console-based financial analyzer

## 📌 Expense Categories

The program includes four predefined categories:

- Food  
- Transportation  
- Entertainment  
- Education  

Users can enter multiple daily expense values for each category.

- Multi-day expense entry  
- Dynamic data storage using dictionary + lists  
- Category total calculation using dictionary comprehension  
- Overall total expense calculation  
- Percentage breakdown per category  
- Identification of the highest spending category  
- Safe handling of empty input cases
