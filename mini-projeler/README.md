# 🚀 Mini Projects — Python Console Applications

This folder contains practical, console-based mini projects developed while learning Python fundamentals.  
Each project focuses on applying core programming concepts to real-world inspired problems.

The goal of this section is not just syntax practice — but building structured, interactive systems using clean logic and organized data structures.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Folder

- Reinforce Python fundamentals through hands-on projects  
- Practice real-world problem modeling  
- Improve algorithmic thinking  
- Strengthen data structure usage (lists, dictionaries)  
- Build structured, portfolio-ready mini systems

## 📂 Included Projects

### ▶️ Collatz Analyzer
Analyzes a number using the 3n+1 (Collatz Conjecture) sequence.

Features:
- Step-by-step sequence generation  
- Total step count  
- Maximum value reached  
- Odd / even step tracking  
- Input validation and safe exit  

Concepts:
- While loops  
- Mathematical logic  
- State tracking  
- Exception handling

### ▶️ Mini Hospital Scheduler
A console-based hospital appointment booking simulation system that dynamically manages departments, doctors, and available time slots.

Features:
- Complaint keyword analysis (e.g., "kalp", "ateş", "diz", "baş")
- Automatic department matching using a mapping dictionary
- Nested dictionary structure for departments → doctors → available time slots
- Dynamic doctor availability filtering
- Time slot booking with automatic removal of selected slots
- Input validation using `try-except`
- Repeat appointment option

Concepts:
- Nested dictionaries
- List filtering
- String matching with `in`
- State mutation (removing booked slots)
- Loop-based interactive system
- Defensive programming (input validation)

This project represents a higher-level structural design compared to basic CRUD mini apps because it simulates a real-world scheduling workflow with dynamic data updates.

## ▶️ How to Run

Navigate into any project folder and run:

python main.py

Each application runs independently.

## 🌱 Learning Philosophy

These projects are intentionally designed as small but structured systems.  
The focus is:

- Clean logic  
- Clear menu flow  
- Proper input validation  
- Organized data modeling  

They represent stepping stones toward building larger, more complex applications.
