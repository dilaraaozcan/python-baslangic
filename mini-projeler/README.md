# 🧪 Mini Projects — Python Console Applications

This folder contains a collection of **small but complete Python console applications** developed to practice core programming concepts through real, hands-on problems.  
Each mini project focuses on combining multiple Python fundamentals into a single, working application.

These projects represent practical milestones in my Python learning journey.
