# 🔀 If-Else — Conditional Logic Applications (Python)

This folder contains **Python console applications** created to practice and reinforce the use of **if–elif–else conditional structures**.  
Each project focuses on decision-making logic, input validation, and producing meaningful outputs based on different conditions.

The examples are designed to help beginners understand how programs **react to user input** and **branch execution paths** using conditional statements.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Folder

- Learn and practice `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements  
- Build decision-making logic in Python  
- Validate user input and handle incorrect values  
- Apply conditions to real-life problem scenarios  
- Improve algorithmic thinking through branching logic

## 📂 Included Projects

### ▶️ BMI Calculator
A console-based **Body Mass Index (BMI)** calculator that evaluates a user's weight and height and classifies their BMI level.

Features:
- Takes weight (kg) and height (cm) as input  
- Prevents negative or invalid values  
- Calculates BMI using the standard formula  
- Classifies the result as:
  - Underweight  
  - Normal  
  - Overweight  
  - Obese  
- Displays health-related feedback messages  

Key concepts:
- Conditional range checks  
- Mathematical calculations  
- Input validation  
- Formatted console output
